Getting Started with Programming
Conclusion: Part 1
Let's do a quick review!

Data types

strings (e.g. "dogs go woof!")
numbers (e.g. 4, 10)
booleans (e.g. false, 5 > 4)
Variables
We store data values in variables. We can bring back the values of these variables by typing the variable name.

Manipulating numbers & strings

comparisons (e.g. >, <=)
modulo (e.g. %)
string length (e.g. "Emily".length;)
substrings (e.g. "hi".substring(0, 1);)
console.log( ) 
Prints into the console whatever we put in the parentheses.


If / else statements are conditional statements. Under different conditions, the computer will output different things.
